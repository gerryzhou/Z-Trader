{ STEP 1: Replace <FORMULA> with the oscillator formula you wish to plot.  Note that 
  Value1 is a numeric variable, a temporary holding place for the result of your 
  numeric formula.  To assign a non-generic name to your plot, you may replace 
  "Oscillator" (leaving the quotes) with a name you choose.  The specified name will 
  appear in the chart analysis data window. }
input:
	double LevRatio( 1 ) [
		DisplayName = "LevRatio", 
		ToolTip = "Leverage Ratio for ETFs."],
	int Length( 20 ) [
		DisplayName = "Length", 
		ToolTip = "Enter the number of bars to use in the calculation of the MA."];

variables:  
	Avg( 0 );
	
Avg = AverageFC( Close, Length );

if GF_IsBarLastDay(Length) Then
	Value1 = Dailyopen
else
	Value1 = Avg;//Open;//OpenD(0) ;
	
if Value1 <> 0 then
	Value2 = (Close-Value1)/(Value1*LevRatio)
else 
	Value2 = 0;
Plot1( Value2, "OP%Chg" ) ;

once 
Print(Symbol , "= ", Value1, ", ", Close, ", ", Value2);

{ Leave the next plot statement as is. This draws the horizontal zero (0) line. }

//Plot2( 0, "ZeroLine" ) ;

{ OPTIONAL STEPS: To specify alert criteria that will sound an audible alert when 
  triggered, replace FALSE with your criteria.  To specify a brief alert description 
  that will be included in the alert notification pop-up window, insert your 
  description between the quotes ( "" ).  Note that Condition1 is a logical variable, a 
  temporary holding place for the true-false result of the criteria. }

{Condition1 = FALSE ;
if Condition1 then
	Alert( "" ) ;}
